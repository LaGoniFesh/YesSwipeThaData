	â€¢For industrial-strength wiping, tools like shred, dd, or srm are recommended.
					 
â€¢ That said, hereâ€™s a basic Python implementation that overwrites a file's space before deletion.

ðŸ›¡ How This Works:

    It fills free disk space with random data using a temp file.

    The file is overwritten multiple times.

    Finally, the file is deleted.
					 

At this time this only works on HDD and Not SSD. The Concept of this script is to overwrite data with so much data before the file gets deleted that it can not be recovered by Forensic methods. At least not so or simple ones. Enjoy Let me know what features i should add and if i should add a Gui or TUI
